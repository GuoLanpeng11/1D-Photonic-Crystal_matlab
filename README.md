# 1D-Photonic-Crystal_matlab (reflectivityï¼Œ transmittance and dispersion band structure)
These codes are used to calculate the reflectivity, transmissivity and dispersion band of a kind of photonic crystal with periodic structure using transfer matrix method. 
Actually, these are reproduced simulation of a paper, and the access of this paper is DOI: 10.1364/OL.44.001182. You can find the exact parameters of this simulation.
