# 1D-Photonic-Crystal_matlab (reflectivityï¼Œ transmittance and dispersion band structure)
These codes are used to calculate the reflectivity, transmissivity and dispersion band of a kind of photonic crystal with periodic structure. 
These codes are the reproduced simulation of a paper, and the access of this paper is DOI: 10.1364/OL.44.001182. you can find the exact parameters of this simulation.
